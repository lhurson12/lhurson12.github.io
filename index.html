    <p>Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to 
      taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather, he commands 
      the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank just outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but 
      with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their 
      grip on Freehold. </p>
